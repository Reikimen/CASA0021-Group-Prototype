## üìå Introduction

**Aligned** is a paired emotional communication device for people in long-distance relationships‚Äîwhether romantic partners, family, or close friends. Instead of relying on texts or video calls, users connect by physically aligning their devices and sending emotions through light and vibration.

When one user rotates their device to face the direction of their partner and presses a button, a message is sent‚Äîbut it will only be received when the other user also aligns in return. This two-way interaction adds a sense of presence and emotional balance that typical communication tools often lack.

**Aligned isn‚Äôt just a compass‚Äîit‚Äôs your emotional North Star.**

## üåç Why Aligned?

Staying connected across distances can be emotionally draining. Traditional tools like messaging and video calls are often screen-heavy, verbal, and fatiguing.

**Aligned** takes a different approach. It brings back the power of non-verbal connection‚Äîthrough direction, movement, and shared moments. Inspired by studies on the importance of physical cues in emotional bonding, Aligned helps users feel close, quietly and intentionally.

### Step 1: Power on the device  
Press the big start button. The device will automatically calibrate the built-in compass. 

### Step 2: Init the Product with our APP

On first use, you‚Äôll be prompted to connect to your own Wi-Fi using your phone.

### Step 3: Enjoy Our "Alinged"

### üíå If you are the **Sender**:

1. **Rotate to find direction**  
   The device will help you locate the correct direction of your paired partner.  
   Once you are aligned, the LEDs will signal success.

2. **Choose how you feel**  
   Use the emotion buttons to send a feeling:
   - üü° Yellow ‚Üí Happy  
   - üîµ Blue ‚Üí Sad  
   - üî¥ Red ‚Üí Angry  

3. That‚Äôs it ‚Äî your emotion is sent.  
   The other person can now receive it, but **only when they align with your direction**.

---

### üì° If you are the **Receiver**:

1. **Wait for a message**  
   When your partner sends a signal, your device enters **Seek Mode**. The LED ring starts showing **navigation indicators** to help you rotate and align:
   - üü¢ **Green navigation lights** ‚Üí You‚Äôre pointing in the correct direction  
   - üî¥ **Red navigation lights** ‚Üí You're off-target. Try turning in the opposite direction
   
2. Once aligned, the navigation lights will disappear, and the ring will glow in an **emotion color**‚ÄîYellow, Blue, or Red‚Äîdepending on the feeling your partner sent.

### Precautions for use

To ensure optimal performance and longevity of your Aligned device, please observe the following precautions:

**Environmental Considerations**

- Do not place the device near strong magnetic fields as this may affect compass accuracy
- Ensure the device has sufficient space around it during rotation for accurate direction finding

**Battery and Power**
- Use only the provided USB cable for charging
- Do not charge the device while it is in use
- If the battery is completely depleted, charge for at least 10 minutes before attempting to power on

**Operational Safety**
- Do not disassemble or modify the device
- Keep the device away from children under 12 years old
- If the device becomes hot during use, turn it off immediately and allow it to cool

**Connectivity and Privacy**
- Ensure your Wi-Fi network has a stable internet connection
- Location permissions are only required during initial setup
- All emotional data is encrypted during transmission

**Maintenance**
- Keep the device away from water and excessive humidity
- Store the device in a cool, dry place when not in use
- Contact customer support if persistent issues occur

## Technical Architecture
### Software Design

The software architecture of the Aligned system is composed of two primary parts: the Android mobile application built using Flutter, and the firmware running on the ESP32 microcontroller via the Arduino platform. Together, these components enable seamless device initialization, connectivity, and core functionality.

#### Mobile Application (Flutter-based App)

The mobile application serves as the initial setup interface for the Aligned device, providing essential configuration data through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity.

The application establishes a connection using the service **UUID 0000ff01-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb** and transmits data over two feature channels: the **WiFi credentials channel (UUID: 0000ff03-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb)** is used to send the WiFi SSID and password, and the **GPS coordinates channel (UUID: 0000ff02-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb)** is used to transmit location information. The app automatically obtains accurate location information from the phone's built-in GPS module and formats all the data into structured strings, such as SSID:xxx,PASS:xxx and LAT:xx.xxx,LON:xx.xxx, using UTF-8 encoding to ensure that the characters are transmitted correctly.

#### ESP32 Firmware (Arduino-based)

During the runtime phase, the device has multiple operating states: in normal mode, the device is idle and listens for messages; in seek mode, the user must align the device in the right direction to receive a message; in emotion send mode, the user rotates the device to find the direction of the partner and sends the emotion; and in message read mode, the device provides feedback when the direction is aligned.

The Arduino firmware for this project adopts an innovative dual-equal role architecture design, where the device roles can be interchanged at any time; the sender and receiver are not fixed identities but are switched dynamically according to the current interaction needs. The firmware also achieves flexible configuration of multiple pairs of users and dual devices through a single code base, greatly reducing the maintenance cost and deployment complexity of the firmware. 

<div style="text-align: center;">

By defining MODE\_JACK/MODE\_ROSE and COUPLE\_NUM macros in the header file, the system is able to automatically configure the corresponding device name and MQTT topic subscription publishing relationship without writing duplicate code.
