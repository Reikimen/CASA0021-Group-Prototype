### 2. Topic 2: Idea of "linked"
- **Discussion**: 

  - **Linked Idea 1:** 

    The original idea is - Connected to each other in a physical sense, connected when face to face. Therefore GPS had to be used to locate the devices to ensure a face-to-face connection.

    **Issues:**

    1. GPS module consumes more energy
    2. GPS modules are expensive, resulting in higher equipment production costs

    **Solutions:**

    1. Each time the device is switched on, the GPS is used to obtain location information (for about 10s), and is switched off as soon as the location information is obtained, unless the user performs a repositioning operation while using the device, in which case the GPS is switched on for a short period of time, obtains the information, and is switched off automatically.
    2. The Second solution is to use a mobile app that retrieves location details from the personal smartphone of the user and send it to the device to be used in the calculations. This would remove the need for a built-in GPS which automaticaly solves the problem of powering and cost of implementing a GPS module within the device.

  - **Linked Idea 2:** 

    Suppose there are two users, Jack and Rose, who are lovers in a long-distance relationship. Suppose Rose, at a certain point in time, feels sad because her job is not going well. So she switches on our compass, and after switching on the device, she rotates it at a particular angle relative to when the device was switched on and presses the â€˜Stressed Outâ€™ button, while Jack receives a vibration from the compass at the same time ðŸ“³. Jack, after switching on the device, rotates the angle at which Rose pressed the button, at which point the light band on the compass flashes and vibrates slightly, picking up Rose's mood message.
